# World Dictionary — Final Editorial Report

**Date:** 2026-07-21  
**Repo:** `alephbits-content`  
**Branch:** `cursor/world-content-backfill`  
**Phase:** World Content Backfill — **complete**  
**Nature:** Evaluation only — no QuietLibrary, Reader, or application work.

Preceded by [Milestone Review 01](WORLD_DICTIONARY_MILESTONE_REVIEW_01.md).

## 1. Complete dictionary statistics

| Metric | Milestone 01 | Final |
|--------|-------------:|------:|
| Total books | 125 | 125 |
| Books with world | 56 (44.8%) | **125 (100%)** |
| Remaining | 69 | **0** |
| Total concepts | 46 | **44** |
| Multi-use | 24 | **27** |
| Single-use | 22 | **17** |
| Reuse health | 52% | **61%** |

Concept count decreased (46 → 44) because `forge` merged into `shop` and `market_square` into `market` during completion — intentional simplification.

### Category balance (final)

| Category | Count | Share |
|----------|------:|------:|
| places | 17 | 39% |
| objects | 13 | 30% |
| creatures | 8 | 18% |
| plants | 4 | 9% |
| symbols | 2 | 5% |

Places remain largest (appropriate). Creatures/plants/symbols stayed sparse by design.

## 2. Strongest concepts (semantic backbone)

| Concept | Uses | Role |
|---------|-----:|------|
| `home` | 89 | Domestic center of the library |
| `book` | 54 | Learning, memory, literacy |
| `window` | 33 | Threshold interior ↔ world |
| `office` | 28 | Clinics, clinics, institutions |
| `town` | 26 | Civic life |
| `school` | 18 | Teaching & childhood |
| `street` | 17 | Movement / public space |
| `glass` | 15 | Everyday ritual vessel |
| `river` | 8 | Landscape / water stand-in |
| `forest` | 8 | Nature / wonder edge |
| `shop` | 7 | Trade (incl. former forge/café) |
| `library` | 6 | Knowledge rooms |
| `castle` | 6 | Legend architecture |

**Backbone unchanged and stronger:**  
`home` — `street`/`town` — `school`/`book` — `forest`/`river` — `castle`

---

## 3. Singleton review (final 17)

| Identifier | Assessment |
|------------|------------|
| `dragon`, `cave`, `bell`, `gate`, `doll` | **Keep** — high future / QuietLibrary value |
| `bear`, `fox`, `rabbit`, `goat`, `hamster` | **Keep** — await natural second stories |
| `monk`, `ram`, `horseshoe`, `candy`, `cabbage`, `corn`, `burrow` | **Revisit later** — niche; do not expand peers |

No removals performed at completion except the planned merges (`forge`, `market_square`).

---

## 4. Remaining review candidates

See [world/REVIEW_CANDIDATES.md](../../world/REVIEW_CANDIDATES.md).

**Still deferred (not introduced):** `station`, `ocean`, `hall`/`stage`, `playground`, `plane`, `shoe`, `camera`, `box`, `cat`

These did not meet the inevitable-concept test across enough books during completion.

**Completed merges:**

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| `forge` | `shop` |
| `market_square` | `market` |

---

## 5. Approximation review

| Mapping | Final status |
|---------|--------------|
| café / workshop / forge → `shop` | excellent (forge now aliased) |
| mug/cup/tea → `glass` | acceptable |
| clinic / hospital / embassy → `office` | excellent |
| preschool → `school` | acceptable |
| airport / station → `town` + `street` | temporary — revisit `station` later |
| ocean → `river` (+alias) or omitted | temporary — revisit `ocean` later |
| dance hall → `home` | temporary — revisit `hall` later |
| playground → `street` + `ball` | acceptable |
| plane metaphor (*Samolot*, Mars flight) → home/office | temporary — revisit `plane` only if travel cluster grows |
| cat (*Kot 1011*) → home/window only | temporary — revisit `cat` if more animal stories arrive |

## 6. Overall editorial assessment

**The AlephBits World Dictionary now covers the entire published Polish official library.**

Quality markers:

- Coverage **100%** without a vocabulary explosion (44 concepts).  
- Reuse health improved **52% → 61%** during the second half.  
- Four zero-growth batches (4–7) plus a completion pass that **reduced** concept count via merges.  
- Identifiers remain generic, language-independent, and non-plot.  
- Process artifacts (`REVIEW_CANDIDATES.md`, approximation log, Milestone 01) keep the dictionary maintainable.

Remaining weakness: temporary travel/water concepts (`station`, `ocean`) and thin plants/symbols layers — acceptable for QuietLibrary v1 if rooms lean on the backbone above.

---

## 7. Readiness for QuietLibrary

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Full library coverage | **Yes** |
| Stable primary vocabulary | **Yes** |
| Documented approximations | **Yes** |
| Entries `approved` for production clients | **Not yet** — all still `proposed` |
| Temporary concepts resolved | **No** — intentional deferral |
| Taxonomy frozen | **Yes** |

**Recommendation:** QuietLibrary design may begin against the **proposed** vocabulary, but production QuietLibrary should wait for a short **approval pass** that:

1. Marks backbone concepts `approved`.  
2. Decides keep/introduce/drop for `ocean`, `station`, `hall`, `cat`.  
3. Optionally promotes a few legend singletons (`dragon`, `cave`) if Castle room ships first.

**Do not** implement QuietLibrary in this phase.

---

## 8. What this phase delivered

1. Compiler support for optional `world` → `lesson.json`.  
2. Shared content dictionary at `world/dictionary.yaml`.  
3. Editorial guides, review candidates, Milestone Review 01, this final report.  
4. **125/125** packs with curated world metadata.  
5. No Reader / QuietLibrary / recommendation / AI runtime work.
